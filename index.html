<h3 style="color: white;" width="500">I have a feeling that although you said I don't have to answer, you still wanted one and i'm more than happy to write an essay for you. Matter of fact I sprinted up to grab my laptop and open Google Docs. I'm THAT excited to write this. Heads up it's not gonna be very good i'm just writing what comes to my mind at the time.

<h3 style="color: white;">
    So the question, “why out of every guy you picked me”. First of all, I picked you. There is no “why out of every guy”. I understand that the circumstances in which we resumed talking may make it seem like something like that but I didn't “pick” you because some airhead wasn't cutting it or meeting the standard. Frankly if you weren't you, as the perfect person you are we would have remained friends. 

</h3>
<h3 style="color: white;">One thing about me, as delusional as I may have been in past relationships or even situationships, I'm almost always able to tell when something isn't gonna work out or if I think i'll leave at any point. We have been together 6 months and change now and i can say for certain that you aren't going anywhere nor am i. I just know for certain that things will work out with us.

<h3 style="color: white;">But for the actual reasons as to why I choose you to spend the rest of my life with you.
    You embody all of the qualities I want in a boyfriend and eventually husband. You are a top tier communicator and I love it. I love that if there’s anything that bothers either of us or causes tension we can talk about it openly and maturely, I love that if either of us is in our head the other usually notices immediately and we can talk about it, that being said im grateful for the fact that you've only been more and more open and expressive about your feelings. 
    </h3>
 
<h3 style="color: white;">That's another point, you're expressive, it doesn't matter what the situation is, you express anything you feel. And I mean this generally. It could be something pertaining to the two of us or let's say someone does something you don't agree with. It’s a trait I find very attractive. I love it when you speak your mind without care. I love the way you are passionate and expressive about the things you enjoy. Whether it be music, games or movies and series, i love listening to you speak and especially when you go “storytime teehe”.Its freaking adorable. 
</h3>

<h3 style="color: white;">Overall you are a sweetheart trapped in a thugs body. You dont look like a thug obviously but that's the beautiful thing about getting to know someone. 7 months ago i would have never guessed you were this kind and genuine of a person nor that i would be this in love with you. You have a heart of gold and ill do any and everything i can to protect that and treat you the way you deserve to be treated.
</h3>

<img src="/html/elipic3.jpg" width="500" alt="I love you"> 

<h3 style="color: white;">From where I'm standing it does get better than this. I love you with ALL my heart and i wouldn't trade you for the world. I don't think my essay fully captured everything i wanted to say and definitely not everything i feel and while i'm working on my ability to express my feelings i hope my little essay is enough to tell you that i chose you and will continue to do so. I love you so so much baby.
